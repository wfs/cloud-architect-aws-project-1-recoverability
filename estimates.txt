Availability Estimate
Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:


Minimum Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single AZ outage (Region Asia Pacific (Sydney), Availability Zone - ap-southeast-2a): 1hr 15min
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - Alarm condition reached: If we add an Amazon Cloudwatch alarm for Master read/write database ‘alive’ that is polled every 5 minutes in current Region Asia Pacific (Sydney), Availability Zone (ap-southeast-2a). (5 minutes)
00:06 - Amazon Cloudwatch alarm triggers an Amazon SNS text message to on-call staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
00:46 - Remediation started. (5 minutes)
01:11 - Remediation completed. This may require creating a new database instance in the other Availability Zone (ap-southeast-2b) for current Region Asia Pacific (Sydney), importing Replica read-only database instance data from other AWS Region Asia Pacific (Singapore - Secondary), Availability Zone (ap-southeast-1a) and verifying connectivity. (25 minutes)


Minimum RTO for a single region outage (Region - Asia Pacific (Sydney) - ap-southeast-2 - Primary): 1hr 45min
        00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - Alarm condition reached: If we add an Amazon Cloudwatch alarm for Master read/write database ‘alive’ that is polled every 5 minutes in current Region Asia Pacific (Sydney), Availability Zone (ap-southeast-2a). (5 minutes)
00:06 - Amazon Cloudwatch alarm triggers an Amazon SNS text message to on-call staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
00:46 - Remediation started. (5 minutes)
01:31 - Remediation completed. This may require creating a new Master read/write database instance in the other Availability Zone (ap-southeast-1b) for Region Asia Pacific (Singapore), importing Replica read-only database instance data from Availability Zone (ap-southeast-1a). Then create a new Region Asia Pacific (Tokyo) VPC, 1 x CIDR block, 2 x Subnets in 2 x AZs with sub-CIDR blocks, 1 x RDS DB Subnet Group where a new Replica read-only database instance will be created. Verifying connectivity between new Master (Region Singapore) and Replica (Region Tokyo), then delete original now duplicated Replica (Region Singapore). (45 minutes)




Minimum Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for a single AZ outage: 5min
        In a scenario that the MySQL DB instance  (read / write) Main in Region - Asia Pacific (Sydney) - ap-southeast-2 - Primary, Availability Zone - ap-southeast-2a is unavailable, then the MySQL DB instance (read)  Replica in Region - Asia Pacific (Singapore) - ap-southeast-1 - Secondary, Availability Zone - ap-southeast-1a can be reconfigured to be accept both read / write operations. As the Replica has been receiving data from the Master, then the RPO is < 5 minutes to allow for intermittent network outages.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html#USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.Monitor




Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 5min
        In a scenario where either the Main or Replica databases are unavailable due to either Sydney or Singapore Regions becoming unavailable, then the RPO is still < 5 minutes to allow for intermittent network outages.
